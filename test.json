Alvida confronts Luffy, but he escapes and knocks her pirate crew down with his Devil Fruit power. Luffy explains that he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, therefore he has the properties of rubber. Coby, inspired by Luffy, stands up for himself when Alvida confronts them. Luffy uses his Gum-Gum Pistol technique on Alvida. Luffy and Coby sail away in a \"borrowed\" boat from Alvida's crew.

Kuro then steps into Kaya's room, and he holds his blood-stained claw over Kaya's head, remembering the deed he has to commit the following day. By the coast, the Black Cat Pirates' ship approaches Syrup Village. Jango reiterates the plan to his men. Meanwhile, Luffy, Usopp, Zoro, and Nami stand on the slope leading to the village, and have poured a barrel of oil on it to make it slippery. The plan is that when the Black Cat Pirates slip on the oil, the four will spring out and attack them. Dawn breaks, and so the Black Cat Pirates land on the coast, spotting Luffy's boat. At that moment, Luffy and the others are waiting for the pirates as the sun has now risen, and Nami hears the pirates coming from the north. Usopp notes that there is an identical slope at the north end of the village, and they realize they are at the wrong coast. Panicking, Nami then realizes that their ship is located at the north coast, and their treasure will be robbed by the pirates. Luffy and Usopp take off running for the coast. Zoro and Nami start to leave, but Nami slips on the oil and drags Zoro down the slope, stepping on him to climb back up. Zoro is unable to get up the slippery slope, and he slides to the bottom, but eventually uses his swords to pull his way up. At the north coast, Usopp arrives, surprised that Luffy hasn't come yet, who is now lost. The Black Cat Pirates arrive, and Usopp stands up to them, but realizes he can't beat them by himself. He sees the pirates taking the treasure from the Straw Hats' ship, and he says that the treasure belongs to him, and he'll give it to them if they leave. Jango decides to hypnotize Usopp instead, but Nami arrives in the nick of time and whacks Usopp in the head, knocking him over, refusing to give up her treasure. Usopp then reports that Luffy has not arrived yet, and is probably lost. The Black Cat Pirates then charge, and Usopp stands up to them, but they knock him down swiftly.

Once the hypnotism takes effect, the pirates became wild and ravenous, and foaming at their mouths, they charge at the Straw Hats. One pounds down a cliff with his fist. Zoro says that he and Luffy will handle it, but Luffy was also hypnotized, becoming a wild animal himself. Luffy charges down the slope and uses his Gum Gum Gatling technique to plow through the pirates with ease. Luffy keeps charging, and soon runs past the pirates, causing Jango to fear that he will be the next target. Luffy takes the bow of Kuro's ship in an attempt to kill him, but Jango hypnotizes Luffy, and so Luffy falls asleep, the bow falling on top of him and squishing him as he does this. With Luffy out of the way, Jango prepares for the next attack. Seeing the pirates are defeated, he calls for Siam and Butchie and orders them to attack. They turn out to be cowards, but after some heavy persuasion they charge for Zoro. Zoro blocks their claws with his sword, and engages in a great fight with the two Meowban Brothers. Zoro slashes Siam through the lowersection, but finds out Siam has a very thin waist. He sits on top of Zoro and Buchie leaps down, but Zoro manages to avoid the bone-crushing attack that leaves a crater. Butchie then uses his cat-like abilities to steal Zoro's two swords, and throws them away. Zoro has no chance to grab them and faces another assault by the Nyaban Brothers. Usopp decides to help and fires at the brothers, but Zoro blocks it with his back, yelling at Nami and Usopp to not get themselves killed. Nami then runs for Zoro's swords, picking them up, but Jango reacts swiftly and slashes her in the shoulder with his chakram.

They charge at Kuro but only swing at thin air, and Kuro appears behind them, holding his claws to their necks. He says that everyone has five minutes to finish their job, or he will kill them all. He releases the Meowban Brothers, pushing them so that they can continue their battle with Zoro. However, Nami sees her chance and kicks Zoro's swords through the air. Zoro catches them, and as the Meowban Brothers charge at him he unleashes a great Toragiri, taking both of them down with one mighty swing. He turns to Kuro and declares he won't even need five minutes. Nami realizes how dangerous Kuro is, and so runs to wake up Luffy. As she runs, Jango spots her, and hurls a chakram at her. Nami turns and steps on Luffy's face, waking up Luffy abruptly. He springs up, pulling Nami down just as the chakram strikes him right in the mouth. Luffy stays standing, though, and he breaks the chakram with his teeth. He then sees Nami is wounded, and furious, prepares for battle with Kuro. At the mansion, Kaya wakes up from a nightmare, and she heads down the stairs to find Merry leaning against the wall, bloody and wounded. Merry explains the whole situation to Kaya, how Kuro is planning to take kill her and take her money in a will. Kaya realizes that Usopp was telling the truth the entire time, and so she puts on her overcoat and sets out. She arrives at the top of the slope, and tells Kuro to stop immediately, and that Merry told her everything. Kuro turns to her and wonders why Merry isn't dead, and Kaya sees the state Usopp is in. Usopp charges in and aims a punch at Kuro's face, but Kuro avoids the swing and so Usopp careens into the ground. Kaya then pulls out a gun and points it at Kuro, ordering him to leave the village. Kuro reminds Kaya of the fun times they had together, and Kaya hesitates. Kuro takes the gun from Kaya's hands, knowing she won't shoot, and he drops it to the ground. Usopp picks up the gun and fires at Kuro, but Kuro sidesteps the shot and knocks Usopp down. From out of nowhere flies Luffy's fist, striking Kuro in the face. As Kuro falls back, Luffy retracts his arm and declares that he has a hundred more where that came from."

She tells the Usopp Pirates to run before they are killed, but they stay and fight, deciding to follow their captain's orders and fight to the death for Kaya. Back at the slope, Kuro claims that he hated being a pirate. Luffy refuses to be like him and Kuro uses his Silent Step to move quickly. Luffy gets the timing right, however, and pounds Kuro down. Kuro gets back up and announces that he is going to kill his entire crew, and that it was part of his plan from the beginning. Luffy claims that Usopp could beat Kuro. Kuro laughs it off and uses Shakushi, causing him to disappear. As Luffy wonders where he went, Nami finishes up looting the Black Cat pirate ship, disappointed by the amount of treasure. She then wonders if the battle is over, but sees that Kuro slashes through several of his crewmates, taking them down quicker than the naked eye can see. Luffy gets even more angry, but just after Kuro slashes him in the chest, he grabs Kuro's arm and slams him onto the ground. Kuro stands up and says that now his crew is suffering because Luffy wouldn't let them die quickly, and so Kuro uses Shakushi once again to disappear. In the forest, at that moment, Jango continues searching for the Usopp Pirates, and they toss him a white flag. Jango walks forward and so the Usopp Pirates launch their ambush. Jango trips over a rope and one of the Usopp Pirates showers him with pepper, making him sneeze. The second jumps out and strikes Jango in the groin with a frying pan. The third leaps down from a large rock and takes a swing at Jango's head, but Jango sits up in time and knocks his attacker away. Kaya then comes out, telling Jango not to hurt the kids, but Jango reports that it was his orders from Kuro to kill the children. Kaya then grabs Jango's chakram and holds it in front of her throat, threatening to kill herself without writing the will. Jango agrees, and so he gets Kaya to write the will. Once finished, he grabs her by the neck and holds her against a tree, holding up a chakram to kill her. Zoro is still running through the woods with Usopp on his back, and Usopp spots Jango.

As he is doing so, Luffy announces that he has finished the pirate flag for their ship, and holds it up. It's a terribly drawn skull and crossbones, of course. The others are horrified of the artwork, and so Usopp tells them that he is a great painter. He paints a pirate flag with his own face on it, but the others reject it so he paints a proper pirate flag, a very nice one at that. They fly it on the mast and continue to sail. As they are sailing, Nami spots an island in the distance with her telescope, saying it is Legendary Treasure Island. Usopp says how he heard that there is a valuable treasure on the island, but if one tries to claim it they will face God's wrath. As the Straw Hats draw nearer to the island, the weather turns foul and the waters very choppy. After a tough sail they make it to the island. The Straw Hats head into the jungle, looking for treasure. Zoro lies down and starts to nap, and as Usopp is shocked at how he can sleep in a creepy place like this, the Straw Hats find themselves surrounded by strange animals, creatures that are combinations of two or more animals. A voice booms through the jungle, claiming to be the Guardian God of the island and telling them to leave. Luffy picks up a lion pig that bites him on the face. The voice is shocked and Luffy explains he ate the Devil's Fruit. A gun then pokes out through a bush and shoots Luffy in the back, but Luffy bounces the bullet into the air with his Gum Gum powers. Luffy then spots a twitching green bush, and the owner of the voice takes off running. Luffy, Usopp, and Nami catch up to the man in the treasure chest, named Gaimon. Luffy explains to him how he wants to go to the Grand Line and claim One Piece, but Gaimon doesn't think he can do it. Luffy and Gaimon converse about how they can't read a map, and Nami is angered by this. Gaimon then explains how he became trapped in the treasure box as Zoro finally joins them. He explains that twenty years ago, he was with his crew in search of the treasure, and as they were leaving, he noticed how the captain never searched on top of a large cliff. Gaimon scaled the cliff but slipped and fell, getting stuck in a treasure box. He found that his crew had left, and he thought he would have the treasure on the ridge to himself, but found he could not climb in the box. When Luffy tries to pull Gaimon out of the box, he explains that his body grew to match the shape of the box, and his body will be ruined if the box is broken. Luffy then realizes that Gaimon uses the strange animals of the island to ward off visitors. Inspired by Gaimon's story, the Straw Hats decide to help Gaimon find the treasure. They come to the ridge and Luffy uses Gum Gum Rocket to launch himself up to the top, where there are five treasure chests. He refuses to hand them over to Gaimon, and while this shocks and angers Nami and Usopp, Gaimon realizes that the treasure boxes must be empty. Luffy confirms this, and so Gaimon begins to cry, saying that he's been guarding nothing for twenty years. Luffy says it could be worse, as he could have died guarding nothing, and he offers Gaimon to join their crew. Gaimon decides to stay with the strange animals of the island, however, as he has decided to protect them instead of the treasure. With this adventure behind them, the Straw Hats set sail in the Going Merry once again, waving goodbye to Gaimon as the episode draws to a close."

Johnny then brings the straw hat pirates' attention to Yosaku, who lies ill on his and Johnny's small ship. Turns out that Johnny, Yosaku, and Zoro used to be bounty hunter partners some time ago. Johnny then proceeds to tell the straw hat pirates that he took Yosaku to a small rock island to rest, which was coincidentally blown up by Usopp and Luffy for target practice in the last episode. Usopp and Luffy quickly apologize. Johnny, however, was more worried about Yosaku's condition, which Nami quickly diagnosed as scurvy caused by a lack of Vitamin C. Luffy and Usopp then shove a bunch of lemons into Yosaku's mouth and Yosaku is revived!... or at least for 5 minutes. The straw hat pirates conclude that they need a cook for their potential nutritional problems. Johnny points out that they probably can find a good candidate in the floating sea restaurant known as Baratie. He also states that the one Zoro has been looking for, Hawk-eyes Mihawk, is near there too. Thus they head to Baratie, which actually is pretty much right next to where they were.

The customers are terrified because Don Krieg is supposedly the strongest pirate in East Blue. The pirate shoots the marine from behind and comes in to order food. Patty recognizes the pirate as a customer and asks if the pirate has any money on him. The pirate points a gun at Patty and says \"is a bullet okay?\" Patty then beats the pirate up and doesn't recognize the pirate as a customer since he has no money. Sanji, on the other hand, heads to the kitchen and starts making a meal. Fullbody in the meantime, leaves the restaurant sneakily (along with the subordinate who got shot earlier, guess he is still alive). Sanji brings his meal to the pirate, who was thrown out by Patty. Sanji states that, for him, a customer is anybody who is hungry. He also states that he understands the feeling of starvation more than anybody else. The pirate then grabs the meal and gobbles it up, while crying and saying that this is the most delicious dish he has ever had in his entire life. Luffy, who was watching the whole thing, attempts to recruit Sanji as the cook for his crew. After refusing and some conversing, we find out that the head chef used to be a notorious pirate and the restaurant often comes into conflict with other pirates after his fame. Luffy, as always, is stubborn and insists that Sanji joins them. We also find out that the other pirate's name is Gin. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, we learn that Don Krieg is the captain of a fleet of 50 ships. Gin thanks Sanji for the meal and leaves. Sanji throws the dishes into the ocean to get rid of the evidence that Sanji is giving out food for free, which makes Gin even more grateful. Luffy is then sent back to work, where he ends up breaking even more dishes and makes a big commotion in the kitchen. The rest of the crew, Zoro, Nami, and Usopp, turn out to be eating a meal at the restaurant. Sanji, after seeing Nami, is captivated by her beauty. While flirting with Nami, the head chef tells Sanji that he's annoying and that he doesn't need him anymore. Meanwhile, Gin informs Don Krieg of the restaurant, where Don Krieg makes clear his intention to \"visit\" the restaurant."

She first extorts Igaram to raise the amount, then she extorts Zoro to save the princess. Miss Monday also decides to try and protect Vivi, but is quickly beaten by Mr. 5's Bomb-Bomb Fruit powers that allow him to create explosions from any part of his body, and Miss Valentine's Kilo-Kilo Fruit powers which allow to change her weight from one to ten thousand kilograms.
